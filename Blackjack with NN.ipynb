    "# BlackJack game:\n",
    "#Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to make the sum of your card values as close to 21, without going over. \n",
    "If we make 21 exactly, we have blackjack, which can't be beat. If we go over 21, we 'bust' and we lose the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The rules of blackjack are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.It is a single player game.\n",
    "2.The game has no gambling system.\n",
    "3.Here we use only a single deck of cards.\n",
    "4.The player and the dealer receive two cards from a shuffled deck. \n",
    "5.After the first two cards are dealt the player is asked if they would like another card (called 'hitting'), \n",
    "  or if they are happy with the cards they have already (called 'staying'). \n",
    "  The player is allowed to stop hitting at any point.\n",
    "6.The number cards (2 through 10) are worth the number displayed, face cards are worth 10, and an Ace can be worth either 1 or     11.\n",
    "7.Once our hand is finished, the dealer tries to do the same. The dealer must keep hitting until they get to 17. If they get       above 17 without busting, they can stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Results:\n",
    "1)If the player has blackjack, they win, unless the dealer also has blackjack, in which case the game is a tie.\n",
    "2)If the dealer busts and the player doesn't, the player wins.\n",
    "3)If the player busts, the dealer wins.\n",
    "4)If the player and the dealer both don't bust, whoever is closest to 21 wins\n",
